'''By limiting the choices the focus can now
be more on data manipulation difficulties.
There are uncomplicated 'verbs', functions present for
tackling every common data manipulation and the thoughts
can be translated into code faster.
There are valuable backends and hence waiting time
for the computer reduces.
